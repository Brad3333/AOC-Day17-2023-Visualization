Advent of Code Visualization â€“ Day 17 (2023)
This project visualizes my solution to Day 17 of Advent of Code 2023, "Clumsy Crucible". 
It computes the optimal path through a heat-loss grid using a Dijkstra-style algorithm with directional constraints, 
then animates the path on a pixel grid where each cell's color represents its heat value.

Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or later
- An IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional)

How to Run
